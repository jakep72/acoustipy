### ***The Theory section is under active development***

### All models and methods described in the Theory section align with the code implementation.

### For each material model, an array of values corresponding to the complex characteristic impedance $(Z_{c})$ and wavenumber $(k_{c})$ are generated and used to calculate that layer's transfer matrix.
